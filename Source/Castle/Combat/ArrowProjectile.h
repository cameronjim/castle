/**
 * An arrow in flight, then stuck in whatever it hit (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "bow
 * and arrows"). A projectile with gravity, launched at the speed the draw earned and turned along
 * its velocity every tick. The collision sphere at the tip sweeps as WorldDynamic, blocking world
 * geometry and pawns but not the hidden traversal ledges, which answer only the Weapon trace
 * channel; the hit is then refined against the victim's physics bodies to find the bone, which is
 * where the headshot multiplier comes from.
 *
 * On hit: ApplyPointDamage, a stagger through the victim's health component, the bow's OnHit;
 * then it embeds, attached to the component (and bone) it hit, and stays for StuckLifeSeconds
 * or until a recoverable arrow is walked over within RecoverRadius.
 *
 * BP_Arrow_Standard is this class; BP_Arrow_Grapple is AGrappleArrowProjectile.
