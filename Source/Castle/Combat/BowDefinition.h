 * One bow (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "bow and arrows"). Draw is a hold from 0 to
 * FullDrawSeconds; the fraction drawn sets the arrow's speed, damage and spread, and a release
 * within PerfectWindowSeconds of reaching full draw adds PerfectBonus damage. Every rule is a pure
 * function here so the numbers are testable without a world.
 *
 * DA_Bow_Kate (0.8 s) and DA_Bow_Clint (1.0 s) are made by Tools/Editor/create_weapon_data.py.
