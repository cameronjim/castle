/**
 * Where every game sound is played from (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "Audio"). Components
 * hold their sounds as soft pointers, set on the Blueprints by create_blueprints.py; these helpers
 * load them synchronously the first time (the standalone game has nothing resident, testing.md 2b),
 * keep them resident for the level so a second shot does not hitch, and log every trigger at
 * Verbose on LogHawkeye so a run can be audited:
 *
 *   -LogCmds="LogHawkeye Verbose"   then grep the log for "Sound:"
 *
 * An unset sound, a world with no audio device (tests, -nullrhi) or no world at all plays nothing
 * and is not an error. The MetaSounds themselves are built by Tools/Editor/create_audio.py.
