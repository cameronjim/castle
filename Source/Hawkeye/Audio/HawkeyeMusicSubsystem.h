/**
 * The combat music (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "Audio", music). Plays MS_Music_Score, one looping
 * MetaSound with every layer on one clock, from the first tick of a game world, and every frame reads the
 * thugs, the local pawn, the crime and the challenge subsystems (GatherInputs), runs FHawkeyeMusicDirector
 * and fades the score's five gain inputs toward the state's layers. MS_Music_Win plays on the win.
 *
 * Each transition logs "Music: <from> -> <to>" on LogHawkeye at Log. Both sounds are soft paths set here,
 * so no map or Blueprint needs to carry them. With no audio device (tests) the rules still run and nothing
 * plays.
