/**
 * An archery challenge's target: a 60 cm face of concentric rings (cream outer, red ring, gold
 * bullseye) on a thin post, spawned by UChallengeSubsystem for one run and removed after. The origin is
 * the foot of the post; the face looks along the actor's +X, tilted by the spawn's pitch. A moving
 * target slides back and forth along its local Y.
 *
 * Only the outer face collides, and only with arrows and the aim trace: AArrowProjectile hands the hit
 * to HandleArrowHit, which measures how far from the centre it landed and reports it to the subsystem.
 * A hit target tips over backwards and stays down.
