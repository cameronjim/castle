/**
 * What a trick arrow leaves behind where it lands (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "trick
 * arrows"). The arrow spawns one at the impact, hands it the hit, and the effect does the rest on
 * its own clock: AHeldEffect (putty), ABolaEffect, ASmokeCloud, AEmpPulse, AExplosiveBlast.
 *
 * Custom actors rather than the Gameplay Ability System: six small effects that each touch one or
 * two existing flags (a thug's knockdown, his controller's held / blinded / jammed) are simpler as
 * a timer on an actor than as abilities, attributes and GameplayEffects nobody else in the game
 * uses. Every effect runs off AdvanceEffect, which Tick calls and a test can call directly.
