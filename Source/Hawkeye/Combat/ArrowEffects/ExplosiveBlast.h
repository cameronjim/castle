/**
 * The explosive arrow's blast. Everything with health within Radius of the impact takes the
 * arrow's damage (80) at the centre falling linearly to 0 at the edge, Kate included if she is in
 * it. Surviving thugs are knocked down for KnockdownSeconds and thrown; the player's camera
 * shakes within ShakeRadius. No cover check: the blast goes round corners. TODO(stage3): occlusion.
 *
 * The look is the orange flash light plus the definition's EffectVfx (NS_Explosion: fireball, core
 * flash, sparks, a smoke puff) and its GroundDecal (M_Decal_Scorch) on the ground found by a trace
 * down from the impact. Without the system the old additive fireball spheres (M_ArrowGlow) stand in.
