/**
 * The smoke arrow's cloud: a Radius sphere that stands for LifeSeconds. It registers with
 * UArrowEffectsSubsystem, and a thug whose line of sight to the player passes through it (or who
 * stands in it) is blinded; Kate crouched inside it cannot be detected at all.
 *
 * The look is a placeholder: the engine ships no ready-made smoke Niagara system (only editor
 * templates) and the project has no starter content, so it is a cluster of soft grey translucent
 * puffs (M_ArrowFx) that swell in over GrowSeconds and thin out over FadeSeconds.
