/**
 * The player's bow (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "bow and arrows"). Replaces the hitscan
 * weapon for the player; thugs keep UWeaponComponent.
 *
 * StartDraw on the fire press, ReleaseDraw on its release. The draw fraction is the hold time over
 * the bow's FullDrawSeconds; a release below MinDrawFraction cancels and spends nothing. Otherwise
 * one arrow of the active quiver slot is spent and its projectile leaves the bow hand toward the
 * point under the reticle (a camera trace finds it), at a speed, spread and damage set by the draw,
 * with PerfectBonus for a release inside the perfect window. The grapple arrow is not a projectile
 * here: releasing with it nocked hands over to UGrappleComponent::TryFire.
 *
 * Also owns the bow's look: the mesh on the back while holstered, attached to the left hand while
 * drawing, turned toward the aim as the draw builds and the string pulled back. With HandsIKClass
 * set (a post-process AnimBP built by UHawkeyeBowIKGraphBuilder) the arms do the work: IK raises the
 * bow hand to the aim and brings the string hand back to the cheek, the bow rides in the palm and
 * the string's nock follows the string hand. Without it (no AnimBP, tests) the grip blends from the
 * hand up to a point held out in front of the left shoulder instead. An arrow sits on the string
 * from the nock forward through the grip while drawing.
