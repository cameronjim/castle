/**
 * Parent class of the bow hands post-process AnimBlueprints (ABP_BowIK_Post for the UEFN
 * mannequin, ABP_BowIK_Post_Thug for the old one), which UHawkeyeBowIKGraphBuilder builds headless.
 * UBowComponent sets the Blueprint as its mesh's post-process AnimBP override, so it runs after the
 * main AnimBP (the sample's motion matching, or a thug's single clip) and layers onto that pose:
 * the spine turns side-on toward the aim, the neck turns back, then two-bone IK puts hand_l on the
 * grip and hand_r on the string.
 *
 * This class only computes the graph's inputs, every animation update, from the owner's
 * UBowComponent: the targets in component space from the head bone and the aim, and the two alphas
 * blended over the settings' BlendSeconds. It has no graph of its own; used directly it would pass
 * no pose through, so it is never set as an override by itself.
 *
 * The same graph poses strikes and hit reactions, since there are no attack or flinch clips: the owner
 * hands it a strike pose (SetStrikePose), whose hand targets win over the bow's while their alphas are
 * above 0, and a hit lean (SetHitLean), a few degrees on spine_01 away from the hit. The graph reads
 * LeftArmAlpha and RightArmAlpha (the bow's or the strike's) and HitLean.
 *
 * With a bow clip playing (BowDraw, BowAimIdle, BowFire, BowNock on the graph's UpperBody slot) the
 * clip holds the arms, as much as the slot is blended in (ClipAlpha is UBowComponent::GetBowClipWeight):
 * the bow hand's IK is off by that much, the string hand stays on the clip with only a small correction
 * toward the arrow line (ComputeStringCorrectionAlpha), the spine drops the side-on turn the clip already
 * has, and the aim offset (AimOffset, when the graph has one) pitches and turns the upper body toward
 * the aim instead of the spine turn. See gameplay-semantics.md, "Combat animation clips".
