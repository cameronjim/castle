/**
 * Builds the bow hands post-process AnimBlueprints headless, so they come from a script like every
 * other asset here (Tools/Editor/create_bow_ik.py calls it). Parent class UHawkeyeBowIKAnimInstance,
 * whose variables the graph reads through variable-get nodes. The anim graph:
 *
 *   Input Pose -> [the mesh's own post-process AnimBP, as a linked anim graph] -> to component space
 *   -> ModifyBone spine_01 (add HitLean) -> ModifyBone SpineBone (add SpineTwist)
 *   -> ModifyBone NeckBone (add NeckTwist)
 *   -> TwoBoneIK hand_l to LeftHandTarget, elbow to LeftElbowTarget, alpha LeftArmAlpha
 *   -> TwoBoneIK hand_r to RightHandTarget, elbow to RightElbowTarget, alpha RightArmAlpha
 *   -> to local space -> Output Pose
 *
 * The spine turns before the IK so the shoulders are where they end up when the arms reach. Both
 * IKs keep the hand's animated rotation relative to the forearm, so wrists stay as the animation
 * had them. Editor builds only; in a cooked game the function logs an error and returns null.
