 * Where and how a combat montage plays (claude-docs/animation.md). Shared by the melee, bow,
 * finisher, dodge and hit-reaction code so the instance choice lives in one place:
 *
 *   - a montage whose slot is UpperBodySlot plays on the post-process instance (ABP_BowIK_Post),
 *     whose graph layers that slot over locomotion from spine_01 up;
 *   - any other montage plays full body on the main instance when it has a graph (the sample's
 *     AnimBP on Kate and Clint, whose DefaultSlot the traversal already uses), else on the
 *     post-process instance's own DefaultSlot (thugs, whose main instance is a single clip).
 *
 * Every function tolerates nulls and returns "did not play", which is what sends the caller down
 * its procedural fallback.
