/**
 * How one combat montage is laid out. Windows are fractions of the source sequence's length (0..1); a
 * start below 0 leaves that window out. The montage may play only part of the sequence
 * (ClipStartSeconds to ClipEndSeconds) at PlayRate, which the builder bakes into the montage's segment,
 * so the montage itself is short and fast and plays at rate 1; the windows are mapped from the
 * sequence's time into the montage's ((t - ClipStartSeconds) / PlayRate) and clamped inside it.
 * Tools/Data/Anims/manifest.json gives these per clip, with per-role defaults in
 * Tools/Editor/import_combat_anims.py.
