/**
 * How fair a fight felt, measured (the scripted fights in LapTest.cpp write it out). Pure: the caller
 * feeds it frames, telegraphs and damage.
 *
 * Annoyance: the share of the fight Kate spent staggered or knocked down (not in control of her own
 * character). Fairness: every hit she takes must come from an attacker who showed a telegraph (a
 * wind-up glow, a raised pistol, a drawn bow) no more than TelegraphWindowSeconds before it landed.
 * An attacker's telegraph is noted every frame it is showing, so the window runs from its last frame:
 * a gunner's third shot, 0.5 s after the glint went off, still counts as warned.
