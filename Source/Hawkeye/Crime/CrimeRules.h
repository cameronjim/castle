/**
 * The street crimes' rules, pure and world-free: when the next one is due, where it may start, when the
 * victim is lost, when its thugs go. UCrimeSubsystem and UCrimeTracker apply them; tests call them
 * directly.
 *
 *   - Every 90 to 150 s of roaming (alive, not in a fight, not in a challenge or a chapter beat, no crime
 *     on) a crime is due. It starts at a City_CrimeSpot_ 25 to 40 m from the player, at least 60 m from
 *     the last crime's spot, preferring one out of her camera's sight; with none, it waits and tries again.
 *   - Never more than one crime at a time. A running crime pauses (its clocks stop) during a challenge
 *     or a chapter beat.
 *   - Mugging fails when the victim has taken VictimHitsToFail hits: one every TimeToFail / Hits seconds
 *     while a thug stands over him and is not fighting the player. Robbery fails when the runner reaches
 *     the escape point with the loot. Any crime is abandoned when the player goes AbandonDistance away or
 *     goes down. All thugs down (or, robbery, the loot picked up) stops it: RewardArrows standard arrows,
 *     a toast, and a completion counted per type in the save.
 *   - A stopped crime's thugs go 60 s after the end once the player is 40 m away; a failed one's after 20 s.
