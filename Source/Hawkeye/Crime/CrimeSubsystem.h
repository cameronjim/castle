/**
 * The street crimes in a running world, Insomniac style: while the player roams, every 90 to 150 s a
 * crime starts at one of the district's City_CrimeSpot_ actors 25 to 40 m from her (out of her sight
 * when one is), with its roster spawned there, a secondary objective marker on it and a HUD line
 * ("[Crime: mugging] 38 m"). One at a time; a running crime pauses during a challenge or a chapter
 * beat. When it ends the marker goes, a toast says how it went, a stopped crime pays its arrows and
 * is counted in the save, and its thugs, victim and loot are cleaned up later (UCrimeRules).
 *
 * The rules are in UCrimeRules and UCrimeTracker; the counts are mirrored into UHawkeyeCampaignState.
 * hawkeye.CrimeInterval sets the seconds between crimes (and lets them start in automation runs, which
 * otherwise never get one); hawkeye.CrimeType forces the type.
