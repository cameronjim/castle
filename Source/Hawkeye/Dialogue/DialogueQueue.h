/**
 * The dialogue rules, with no world, no HUD and no audio. UDialogueSubsystem owns one; tests make
 * one with NewObject and hand it lines and sequences.
 *
 * One line speaks at a time. PlayLine queues a line; PlaySequence queues a sequence's lines, each
 * behind its gap. Advance runs the clock: the line speaking counts down, then the next entry's gap,
 * then it starts. While bInCombat, a sequence's next line waits (its gap does not run) until the
 * fight is over; the line already speaking finishes. A sequence is marked played when its last
 * line starts, and a played sequence does not play again unless asked to.
