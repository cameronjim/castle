/**
 * The AI Hawkeye (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "partner and switching"). Possesses whichever
 * of Kate and Clint the player is not playing and backs up the lead: follows at FollowMinDistance
 * to FollowMaxDistance, takes cover when shot at, attacks what the lead hit in the last
 * AttackWindowSeconds (bow at range, bow strikes inside MeleeRange), goes to a point the lead marks,
 * and gets the lead back up once per fight.
 *
 * Which mode runs is a StateTree (PartnerStateTree, ST_Partner, built headless by
 * UHawkeyePartnerTreeBuilder): a state per mode in priority order, each entered on a
 * FHawkeyePartnerNeedCondition and running a FHawkeyePartnerModeTask that calls RunMode. The
 * controller keeps the senses (who the lead hit, who shot at him, the fight clock) on a
 * ThinkIntervalSeconds timer and exposes them as needs. Without a tree (automation tests, a missing
 * asset) the same timer picks the mode itself with ChooseMode, in the same order.
