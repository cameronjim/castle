 * in order, one state per EHawkeyePartnerMode in priority order (Revive, GoToMark, Cover, Attack,
 * Follow), each entered on a FHawkeyePartnerNeedCondition (Follow has none), each running a
 * FHawkeyePartnerModeTask, and each going back to the root to choose again when its task succeeds.
 * Schema: StateTree AI Component, so the tasks get the AIController as context.

 * Editor builds only; in a cooked game the function logs an error and returns null.
