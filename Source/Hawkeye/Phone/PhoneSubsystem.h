 * The phone in a running world (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "Phone"). Loads DT_Messages
 * (UHawkeyeNarrativeSettings), turns the mission's events into triggers for UPhoneInbox, and when
 * a message arrives shows a 2 s "[Sender]: [first line]" toast and updates the HUD badge.
 *
 * The arrived and read ids, and the messages still waiting on their delay with the seconds they
 * have left, are mirrored into UHawkeyeCampaignState on every change and before every save, and
 * read back at world start and after a load, so SPUD saves them with the campaign. Triggers are ignored
 * while a save is being restored: the objectives it completes silently must not text anyone.
