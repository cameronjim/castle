/**
 * Calls into the Game Animation Sample's traversal, which is Blueprint only, by reflection.
 *
 * The sample puts it in AC_TraversalLogic, a component on SandboxCharacter_CMC (so on BP_Kate):
 *   TryTraversalAction(S_TraversalCheckInputs) -> TraversalCheckFailed, MontageSelectionFailed
 * sweeps forward on the Traversable trace channel (TraceTypeQuery3, which is our first custom
 * channel), casts what it hits to LevelBlock_Traversable, asks it for the front and back ledge
 * (GetLedgeTransforms reads its Ledge_1..4 spline components; a spline's up vector is the ledge's
 * outward normal), picks a montage from CHT_TraversalMontages_CMC and plays it with motion
 * warping in Flying mode. DoingTraversalAction is true until the montage blends out.
 * SandboxCharacter_CMC::GetTraversalCheckInputs builds the sweep from the current speed; the
 * sample's jump input called the two in a row, and we do the same from C++.
