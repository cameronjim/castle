/**
 * The grapple arrow (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, PLANNED: traversal).
 *
 * Every RefreshSeconds it picks the best anchor: enabled, between MinRange and Range of the character, within
 * ConeDegrees of the camera forward, in line of sight of the camera; the smallest angle wins.
 * TryFire shoots a grapple arrow (the quiver slot whose arrow has OnHitEffect Grapple; it has no count,
 * so nothing is spent) through the bow at that anchor, whatever quiver slot is active (Q, or a release
 * with the grapple slot nocked); when it arrives the character
 * zips along a straight line to the anchor's landing point at ZipSpeed, in Flying mode with
 * gravity and movement input off (the camera still turns). From the ground the line starts at a
 * launch point ZipLaunchHeight above where she stood, reached by a ZipHopSeconds hop, so a level
 * or downward line clears her own parapet. Firing again mid-zip is allowed once
 * ZipProgress reaches ChainMinProgress; the chain arrow travels at ChainArrowSpeed (0: it is there
 * at once) so the zip is redirected to the new anchor in the air, the direction of travel turning
 * onto the new line over RedirectBlendSeconds rather than snapping. A zip blocked by
 * anything but the anchor's own building (the one under its landing point, and any static actor
 * within SupportRadius of the anchor) or, until she is ZipStartIgnoreRadius clear of the start,
 * the geometry round where she stood (her own roof and parapet; after a mid-air chain, also the
 * building the old line was landing on), stops and drops the character.
 * Jump or crouch mid-zip lets go (CancelZip). Arrows stay in the
 * anchor until the character is within RecoverRadius of it, and are tidied away then (there is no count to add them to).
 *
 * Anchors are bucketed into a GridCellSize grid the first time they are needed, so the query
 * only looks at the cells around the character however many anchors the district has.
