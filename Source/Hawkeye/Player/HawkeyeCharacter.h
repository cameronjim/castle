/**
 * The player character, in third person: a spring arm behind and above the body that probes
 * against the world, the camera on the end of it, and the body turning to face the way it moves
 * (or the camera, while aiming). Aim blends the arm in to the right shoulder.
 *
 * Movement picks a gait every frame (walk, run, sprint, crouch, slide) from how hard the stick
 * is pushed and for how long; every number is a property so BP_Kate can tune it. Landings are
 * measured from the top of the arc: a long drop rolls (moving) or stumbles (standing), a
 * controlled drop dips the camera, and a very long one costs health, never all of it.
 *
 * Body animation: when the mesh runs an AnimBP (BP_Kate: the Game Animation Sample's
 * motion-matched SandboxCharacter_CMC_ABP) the AnimBP owns the body, and the idle/walk/run clip
 * switch in LocomotionAnim.h only runs for a mesh without one. A class that carries the sample's
 * CharacterInputState (SandboxCharacter_CMC and its children) gets our gait, crouch and aim
 * written into it every update; see SyncGaspInputState.
 *
 * BP_HawkeyeCharacter is the input-wired base; BP_Kate is the playable child.
