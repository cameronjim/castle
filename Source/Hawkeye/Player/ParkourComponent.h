 * Vault, mantle and ledge grab (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, traversal).
 *
 * A few traces ahead of the character find the front face, the top, whether the capsule fits on
 * (or just over) the top, and whether there is a back edge with a floor beyond it; ChooseMove
 * turns the numbers into a move. Sprinting into an obstacle within AutoTriggerDistance starts it
 * on its own; the jump key starts it at any speed. Vault and mantle go to the Game Animation
 * Sample's traversal first (GaspTraversal.h) when the owner carries it; when the sample finds no
 * traversable block or no montage fits, or the owner has no sample, this component moves the
 * capsule itself: along the root motion of a sample clip (or a plain arc when there is no
 * animation), warped so it starts where the character is and ends on the far side, on top, or
 * at the hang point. Input is locked exactly as long as the move lasts.
 *
 * The ledge grab has no sample equivalent: the character jumps to a hang (the sample's 2.5 m
 * climb clip paused where the hands reach the edge), then the jump key climbs and crouch drops.
 * Falling past a ledge between CatchMinHeight and CatchMaxHeight above the feet catches it.
 *
 * The jump key is forgiving (2026-09-28): it probes a fan of rays around the stick direction (or
 * the facing), reaches ManualTriggerDistance, and takes tops from JumpMinHeight. When nothing fits
 * and a plain jump starts, the late catch re-probes every tick for LateCatchSeconds and takes a
 * mantle or a ledge the moment one fits; a press during a move is buffered for JumpBufferSeconds
 * and fires when the move ends.
 *
 * The way down: standing within DropToHangReach of an edge with more than DropToHangMinDrop
 * beyond it (a roof edge over its parapet, a fire-escape landing over its rail, or any walkable
 * edge), TryDropToHang goes over it to the same hang on its outer face. A drop from that hang
 * catches the next ledge below, so a fire escape comes down as hang, drop, catch, drop.
