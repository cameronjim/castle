/**
 * The campaign save: one slot, "HawkeyeCampaign", written by SPUD (Plugins/SPUD, sinbad/SPUD).
 *
 * SPUD stores every ISpudObject actor in the level (Kate and Clint: transform, health, quiver;
 * thugs: position, dead or alive) and the global UHawkeyeCampaignState (chapter, objectives,
 * safehouses). This subsystem decides when to save (objective complete, safehouse, 60 s of calm
 * roaming), whether a save may be loaded (version, stale chapter), and hands the campaign state
 * to the mission once the reloaded map has started it.
 *
 * SPUD also carries level state across any map travel by default; this game only wants explicit
 * saves, so every travel that is not a SPUD load starts SPUD afresh (see HandlePreLoadMap).
 * Rules: claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "Save data".
