/**
 * Screenshot capture for the -game screenshot passes, one at a time and checked on disk.
 *
 * FScreenshotRequest holds a single pending request: a second RequestScreenshot before the viewport
 * has drawn the first replaces its file name, and a viewport that does not draw (a minimised or
 * zero-sized window) keeps the request forever. Either way the PNG never appears and the test used
 * to pass. Request() queues instead: the next capture is only issued once the previous file is
 * written. Each capture is taken through UGameViewportClient::OnScreenshotCaptured and its PNG is
 * encoded and written on a worker thread, so the frame pays for the read-back only. Every test that
 * requests shots ends with FHawkeyeWaitForShots, which waits for its queue to drain and fails the
 * test for every file that is missing, empty, or older than its request.
