 * on the Blueprints and data assets by create_blueprints.py; these helpers load them synchronously
 * the first time (the standalone game has nothing resident, testing.md 2b), keep them for the level,
 * and log every request at Verbose on LogHawkeye:
 *
 *   -LogCmds="LogHawkeye Verbose"   then grep the log for "Vfx:"
 *
 * Every request is counted by event name, even when the system is unset or the world has no
 * renderer, so tests assert that the call was made (testing.md: assert on calls, not effects).
 * The systems themselves are built by Tools/Editor/create_vfx.py.
