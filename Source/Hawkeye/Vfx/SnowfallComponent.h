 * Light snow round the local player's camera (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "Effects"). Lives
 * on the player controller, so it follows whichever character is possessed. At BeginPlay it spawns
 * SnowSystem (NS_Snowfall: 800 GPU flakes the view recycler keeps inside the frustum) and every frame
 * puts it at HawkeyeVfxMath::ComputeSnowfallOrigin for the camera, so its bounds always hold the view.
 * Only outdoors: a map whose game mode has bOutdoorWeather off (a flashback's playable scene, an
 * interior) gets no snow at all.
