/**
 * Something the player examines to finish a chapter (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "Chapter
 * end"). Interact asks the controller for a close-up on CloseUpCamera (the view blends in, pushes
 * slowly toward the prop for CloseUpSeconds and blends back), then completes ObjectiveId. When that
 * completes the mission, the controller's end sequence starts with the close-up: close-up, end card,
 * the flashback if the mission has one, then roaming again or the next level.
 *
 * Generic: what it looks like is Prop and PropAccent's meshes and materials, set by whoever places
 * it (Tools/Editor/generate_city.py puts CH01's, City_ChapterEnd, in the find_arrow water tower).
 * Like an objective volume it registers its location as ObjectiveId's marker point.
