/**
 * Spawns the district's roof-edge ledges and grapple anchors from a UCityLedgeData at load, so the
 * map does not carry five thousand saved actors (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, traversal).
 *
 * BeginPlay spawns every anchor (and rebuilds every grapple component's anchor grid) and every
 * ledge within ImmediateRadius of the player, then the rest of the ledges nearest first, at most
 * FrameBudgetMs of each frame, logging both times. Each ledge is a Blueprint whose construction
 * script costs about 0.3 ms, so all 3,700 at once would hitch the load by well over a second.
 * SpawnAll() does everything at once; verify_city.py calls it. In the editor the actors appear
 * only while bSpawnInEditor is on; editor-spawned actors are transient and never saved.
 *
 * Every ledge is LedgeClass (BP_TraversableBlock) with its meshes hidden and blocking only the
 * Traversable channel (ECC_GameTraceChannel1), tagged City, CityLedge and osm:<id>. Every anchor
 * is AnchorClass (BP_GrappleAnchor) tagged City, CityAnchor and osm:<id>. In an editor world they
 * also get their generator labels (City_Ledge_<osm id>_<edge>, City_Anchor_<n>).
 *
 * Fire escapes: every FCityFireEscapeRecord is an AFireEscapeLanding (its collision, tagged City,
 * CityFireEscape, osm:<id>, floor:<n>, labelled City_FireEscape_<osm id>_<floor>) plus a LedgeClass
 * block on its outer rail (City_FireEscapeLedge_...), queued nearest first with the roof ledges.
 * Their visible bars are instances in two transient instanced-mesh components (cube and
 * cylinder, FireEscapeMaterial), all added at once; they are never saved with the map.
 *
 * Clutter: every FCityClutterGroup becomes one transient hierarchical instanced mesh (water towers,
 * HVAC boxes, chimneys, hydrants, bins, bags, scaffolding, parked cars), added at once at load. A
 * group with bCollision blocks pawns and physics but ignores the visibility, camera and traversable
 * traces, and none of them affect navigation.
 *
 * Chimney wisps: in a game world, ChimneyWispCount of the chimneys nearest the player at load get
 * a slow smoke stream (ChimneyWispVfx, NS_ChimneyWisp) ChimneyTopCm above their base, spawned on the
 * spawner's first tick rather than in BeginPlay so they stay out of the load.
