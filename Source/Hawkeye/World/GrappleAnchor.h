/**
 * Something a grapple arrow can bite into: a rooftop corner, a vent, a pipe. The actor's origin
 * is the base of the fitting; +X points inboard, towards LandingPoint, which is where the
 * character's feet end up after the zip (on the roof surface, clear of the parapet).
 *
 * Arrows that land here stay stuck in it until the player comes within the grapple component's
 * RecoverRadius and pulls them back into the quiver (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md,
 * traversal: "the arrow is recoverable at the anchor").
 *
 * BP_GrappleAnchor gives it its dark steel look; the generated district places City_Anchor_<n>.
