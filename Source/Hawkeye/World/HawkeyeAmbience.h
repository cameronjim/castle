/**
 * The district's sound bed (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "Audio"): rooftop wind and the street's
 * hum, non-spatial loops crossfaded by how high the listener's pawn stands above this actor (placed
 * at street level by generate_city.py as City_Ambience). Wind is at its floor under 3 m and full from
 * 10 m up; the street falls to a third up there. The fade is HawkeyeAudioMath::ComputeAmbienceMix. The street
 * level is split between a night bed and a day bed by the time of day's DayBedWeight
 * (HawkeyeAudioMath::ComputeStreetBeds), crossfading over BedCrossfadeSeconds when it changes.
