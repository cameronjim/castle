/**
 * The one screenshot queue the game and the tests share: captures run one at a time, each checked on
 * disk once written.
 *
 * FScreenshotRequest holds a single pending request: a second RequestScreenshot before the viewport
 * has drawn the first replaces its file name, and a viewport that does not draw (a minimised or
 * zero-sized window) keeps the request forever. Request() queues instead: the next capture is only
 * issued once the previous file is written. Each capture is taken through
 * UGameViewportClient::OnScreenshotCaptured and its PNG is encoded and written on a worker thread, so
 * the frame pays for the read-back only. OnDone runs on the game thread once the file is checked
 * (exists, not empty, not older than the request) or the capture failed or timed out.
 *
 * Owner is only a tag the counts are kept by (the screenshot tests pass their test, the playtest kit
 * its subsystem). HawkeyeShots (Tests/) is the automation wrapper.
