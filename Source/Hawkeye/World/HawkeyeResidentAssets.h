 * play (Kate, Clint, the thugs, with their animation Blueprints, meshes and the Game Animation
 * Sample's chooser tables behind them), the motion-matching databases with their animations, and
 * the effects and sounds the world subsystems stream in.
 *
 * Without it every OpenLevel (a death loading the last save, the flashback's playable scene and
 * back) collected all of it with the old world and loaded it again from disk: 12 to 14 s of the
 * same ~1,300 animations and ~160 databases each time. The game instance outlives the worlds, so
 * a reference held here outlives the travel. Nothing is loaded here; it only keeps what a world
 * already loaded.
