/**
 * The district's safehouses and fast travel between them.
 *
 * Every ASafehouse registers here at BeginPlay. The rules (tested in FastTravelTest.cpp):
 * - A safehouse is discovered by walking into its entry zone (or entering it with E); only discovered
 *   ones can be travelled to, and they show on the compass as a small house.
 * - The fast-travel list is every safehouse in the district but the one you are at, in id order;
 *   undiscovered ones are listed as "[Undiscovered]", greyed, and cannot be picked.
 * - Travel is refused, with a "[Can't fast travel now]" toast, while a street crime is on or a side
 *   challenge is running, and while a travel is already under way.
 * - Travel: fade to black (FadeOutSeconds), move the player to the destination's door and the partner
 *   beside her, record it as the last-used safehouse, autosave ("fast travel"), hold (HoldSeconds),
 *   fade back in (FadeInSeconds). No map load: the district is one map. Under 3 s from fade to fade.
 * - The pause menu's "Mark nearest safehouse" puts a secondary objective marker on the nearest
 *   safehouse, found or not (an unfound one is "[Unknown safehouse]" with a "?"); walking into any
 *   safehouse clears it. Every safehouse is on the compass: found ones as a house, unfound hollow.
 * - The first time the player comes within NoticeRadius of an unfound safehouse, a "[Safehouse
 *   nearby]" toast and the marker on it (AHawkeyePlayerController asks FindUnnoticed; the save keeps
 *   the noticed ids).
