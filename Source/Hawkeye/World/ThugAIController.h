 * Thug brain. The senses (perception, the archer's own sight check, smoke, the squad alert, the
 * clocks that move Calm, Suspicious and Alerted) run on a 0.25 s think timer. What he does is one
 * EThugMode at a time, chosen by a StateTree (the pawn's ThugStateTree, ST_Thug, built headless by
 * UHawkeyeThugTreeBuilder in the partner's pattern): a state per mode in priority order, each entered
 * on a FHawkeyeThugNeedCondition and running a FHawkeyeThugModeTask that calls RunMode. Without a tree
 * (tests, a thug spawned from C++) Think picks the mode itself with ChooseMode, in the same order.
 *
 * Patrol      Calm: PatrolPoints, waiting PatrolWaitSeconds at each
 * Investigate Suspicious: walk to the last stimulus, wait InvestigateSeconds, back to Calm
 * Attack      Alerted, by weapon. Fists and Bat rush in at RushSpeed; inside MeleeEngageRange (250)
 *             they wind up a swing, close to MeleeCloseDistance, swing again after
 *             MeleeCooldownSeconds, and back off after MeleeSwingsBeforeBackOff swings. The gunner
 *             fires 3-shot bursts after a 0.8 s telegraph and ducks into cover after a burst or when
 *             aimed at. The archer draws for 1.2 s and looses with lead at the chest.
 * Cover       the gunner at a cover point (EQS_CoverPoints, or a C++ ring of candidates): hides,
 *             peeks for a burst, and relocates every RelocateSeconds.
 * Reposition  the gunner backing off to RetreatToDistance when she is inside RetreatTriggerDistance;
 *             the archer zipping to another roof's grapple anchor when she is inside ArcherCloseRange.
 *
 * Alerted drops to Suspicious after LoseTargetSeconds with no perception. Going Alerted tells the
 * squad: after SquadAlertDelay, thugs within SquadAlertRadius with a line of sight to him turn
 * Suspicious toward where he last had her.
