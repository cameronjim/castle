 * Whether a noise reaches a thug through the building (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md, "Interiors").

 *  - a clear line from the noise to his head, or one OverheadRise above both ends (over a balustrade, a
 *    counter, a parked car), and he hears it within the range;
 *  - otherwise the sound goes the way a person would walk: he hears it when the navmesh path from the
 *    noise to him is within the range, and within ClosedDoorFactor of it when that path goes through a
 *    closed door;
 *  - no path at all (another floor with no stair, a sealed room): he does not.

 * Walls, floors and door leaves count (world static and world dynamic); pawns and bodies do not.
