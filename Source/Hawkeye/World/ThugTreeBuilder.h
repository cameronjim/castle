/**
 * Builds the thug brain's assets headless, the way UHawkeyePartnerTreeBuilder builds ST_Partner
 * (Tools/Editor/create_enemies.py calls both functions):
 *
 *   ST_Thug          a root that tries its children in order, one state per EThugMode in priority
 *                    order (Stunned, Reposition, Cover, Attack, Investigate, Patrol), each entered on a
 *                    FHawkeyeThugNeedCondition (Patrol has none), each running a FHawkeyeThugModeTask,
 *                    each going back to the root when its task succeeds. Schema: StateTree AI Component.
 *   EQS_CoverPoints  an EnvQuery data asset: a donut of candidates round the querier (3 rings of 12,
 *                    120 to 800 cm, projected onto the navmesh), filtered by a trace from the thug's
 *                    target (UHawkeyeEnvQueryContext_ThugTarget) that must be blocked, scored nearest
 *                    first. Authored through UEnvQuery's options directly: no EQS editor graph, so the
 *                    asset shows an empty graph if opened in the editor (do not save it from there).
 *
 * Editor builds only; in a cooked game both functions log an error and return null.
