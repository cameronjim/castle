"""Interior layouts: read and check a layout description, and work out the geometry generate_interior.py
builds from it. Pure Python with no unreal import, so Tools/Editor/test_interior.py (Tools/test-interior.ps1)
tests every rule here without an editor.

A layout is JSON (Tools/Interiors/<name>.json), in cm, in the interior map's own frame: +X east, +Y south,
so a room's N side is its y0 edge (the district's convention: East 11th Street has a smaller Y than East
6th). Floor k's floor is at z = k * FLOOR_HEIGHT; every slab is SLAB thick with its top at that height.

      "exit_signs": [{"room", "side", "floor", "at"}]  green signs over openings, besides the exits' own
    }

An enemy stands at "at" in his room (room-relative, on its floor; the first patrol point when there is no
"at"), turned "facing" degrees (0 east, 90 south; toward his first leg when left out). With a "patrol" of
two points or more he walks round its points in order, waiting "wait" s at each: from "at" to the first,
or, with no "at", from the first to the second. A point with a fourth number is one he turns to that yaw
at while he waits (a gunner overlooking a hall). With no patrol he holds his post. "alert_group" names his crew: his squad alert reaches only thugs of the same group (and a thug with
none only thugs with none). "type" picks the Blueprint: BP_Thug for FISTS, BAT and PISTOL, BP_Archer for
BOW, BP_Thug_Heavy for SHIELD. A keycard's carrier drops it where he goes down (takedown or fight).

A room may span several floors ("floors": 2 is a double-height hall or a stair well). A room with
"overlooks" is a mezzanine inside that room's upper floor (a gallery over a hall); the edges listed in
"rail" face the open volume and get a balustrade instead of a wall.

The walls come from a coordinate-compressed grid: every room edge's x and y cut the plan into cells, each
cell on each floor band has one owner (a mezzanine wins over its host), and a wall stands on every cell
edge whose owners differ. So shared walls are built once, and a wall exists exactly where two spaces
meet. Walls are WALL thick, centred on the line.
