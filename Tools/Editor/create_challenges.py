"""Create the district's side challenges from its geometry (claude-docs/gameplay-semantics.md,
"Side challenges").

    /Game/Challenges/DA_Challenge_archery_<n>     UChallengeDefinition, three archery ranges
    /Game/Challenges/DA_Challenge_traversal_<n>   UChallengeDefinition, three traversal routes

Everything is planned from the same OpenStreetMap records generate_city.py builds the district from
(footprints, heights, parapets, grapple anchors, fire escapes, clutter), so the challenges move with
the city and nothing is placed by hand:

* archery, from three rooftops: a shooting spot on a roof 10 to 25 m tall with twelve targets 10 to
  40 m from it on other roofs and on fire-escape landings, every line from the bow to a target's
  centre and to its bottom edge clear of every building, parapet and rooftop prop. Four slide on a
  6 m track across the line of fire; four stand on landings. 60 s; medals at 36 / 60 / 84 points.
* traversal, from three street corners: eight checkpoint rings, 200 cm across: along the sidewalk,
  a grapple to a roof, across the roof (over a parapet onto a neighbour where one is a step up), a
  grapple to another roof, across it, a grapple to a roof with a fire escape, to the spot behind its
  top landing, and down the escape to the street. Every grapple is within the arrow's 2500 cm of
  where she stands, and its line clears every other building. 150 s; medals under 120 / 90 / 60 s.

Challenge names are bracketed placeholders ("[Archery challenge 1]") until the side content is
written. generate_city.py places a City_Challenge_<id> pedestal (AChallengeStart) at each
definition's StartLocation; verify_city.py counts them and checks every checkpoint is reachable.

Idempotent: an asset is rewritten only when its planned values differ from what it holds.
