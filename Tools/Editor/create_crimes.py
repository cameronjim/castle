"""Create the street crimes' assets and plan where they can start.

    /Game/Crimes/DA_Crime_<type>              UCrimeDefinition: mugging, robbery, ambush, rooftop
    /Game/Blueprints/AI/BP_Civilian           ACivilian: the mugging's victim, the old SK_Mannequin
    /Game/Characters/Civilian/M_Civilian      the victim's neutral grey (skeletal usage)

and ``plan_crime_spots(district)``, which generate_city.py places as City_CrimeSpot_<n> (ACrimeSpot):
fourteen to sixteen places a crime can start, planned from the same OpenStreetMap records the city is built from,
so nothing is placed by hand:

* eight on the street at block corners (create_challenges.street_corners: on the sidewalk 2.5 m out
  from a building's corner where two roads meet), nearest the PlayerStart first, each with an escape
  point on the sidewalk 60 m along one of its streets for the robbery;
* four on roofs 8 to 25 m tall with a grapple anchor, a spot 4.5 m clear of every edge and prop, and
  no chapter or challenge business on them;
* two to four in alleys: the middle of a 3 to 6 m gap between two footprints (a ray off each wall to
  the next building), 8 m past every carriageway's edge, 1.4 m from every wall, clear of the street
  clutter, and joined to a sidewalk by a walk never nearer than 1.4 m to a wall (a 50 cm grid search,
  at most 50 m; a rear yard with no way out but through a building is a dead end). A block with fewer
  than two such alleys gets two spots on the park's interior paths instead;
* none within 40 m of a safehouse door, a challenge pedestal or the interior entrance's doorstep, none
  within 25 m of chapter 1's thugs or archers, and every two at least 35 m apart.

Street corners take the mugging, robbery and ambush; alleys the mugging and ambush; rooftops the
rooftop crime. The names are
bracketed placeholders ("[Crime: mugging]"); civilians have no lines, only "[thank you]".

Idempotent: an asset is rewritten only when its planned values differ from what it holds.
