"""Generate the greybox East Village district from OpenStreetMap data.

    /Game/Maps/L_District_EastVillage          the map (World Partition off for one block)
    /Game/City/EastVillage/Meshes/SM_City_*    one static mesh per building, road, sidewalk

Input is what Tools/fetch-osm.ps1 wrote: Tools/Data/osm/east_village.buildings.json and
east_village.streets.json (lat/lon; this script projects them with _geo.py).

What gets built, all with Geometry Script from Python (the GeometryScripting plugin):

* every building: the footprint extruded to its height (append_simple_extrude_polygon, ear
  clipped so concave footprints work; courtyard holes are ignored), a 30 x 90 cm parapet ring
  just inside the roof edge, per-face normals, complex-as-simple collision so the player can
  stand on roofs and walk into walls. Actor ``City_Bldg_<id>`` in the MI_Facade_<style> that
  facade_style picks (brick or brownstone tenements, stone over 30 m, painted grey garages): M_Facade
  draws the window grid, storefronts, cornice and lit windows from world position, snow on top.
* one ground slab under the whole district at z = 0 (``City_Ground``, snowy MI_Prop_Ground).
* per named road way: carriageway at z = +2 cm (``City_Road_<id>``, wet M_StreetAsphalt) and the 4 m
  sidewalks either side at z = +15 cm (``City_Sidewalk_<id>``, M_SidewalkSnow). Sidewalks are
  the road's buffer minus every carriageway, so they stop at the kerb of each crossing street.
* the park at z = +5 cm (``City_Park_<id>``, M_ParkSnow), minus the carriageways.
* a January night: a 0.3 lux blue moon (``Moon``, the sky atmosphere's light) 30 degrees up, the sky
  light, the height fog as night haze, stars on ``City_NightSky`` (M_NightStars on the engine
  sphere), fixed exposure and a purple-shadow, cream-highlight grade with a vignette; a PlayerStart on East 7th Street facing the tenement row across
  from Tompkins Square Park, a NavMeshBoundsVolume.
* street lamps every 30 m on both sidewalks of every road (``City_Lamp_<n>`` spot light plus
  ``City_LampPole_<n>`` and ``City_LampHead_<n>``); only the ones around the park cast shadows.
  The 20 nearest the park hum: ``City_LampBuzz_<n>`` (AAmbientSound, MS_Amb_LampBuzz, tag CityLamp so
  the EMP silences it too), 3 m up the pole.
* ``City_Ambience`` (AHawkeyeAmbience) at street level: rooftop wind and street hum, crossfaded by
  the player's height above it.
  The lit windows are in the facade material.
* chapter 1: the BP_GameMode_EastVillage override (starts DA_CH01_Rooftops), three objective roofs
  picked from the records, each with a 1 m ``City_Beacon_<objective>`` (pole, emissive purple
  ``City_BeaconTop_``, and a movable 300 lm purple ``City_BeaconLight_``) at the end of the roof
  nearest the start, ``City_Obj_<objective>`` trigger volumes on the first two, and on the
  find_arrow roof the chapter's end: ``City_ChapterEndTower`` (a water tower) with
  ``City_ChapterEnd`` (AChapterEndInteractable) stuck in its tank, a black arrow with emissive
  purple fletching that completes find_arrow when examined, and ``City_SceneReturn_FB00`` (an
  ATargetPoint in front of the tower) where the placeholder flashback's scene hands the player back.
* Barney's archers: two ``City_Archer_<n>`` (BP_Archer, tag ArcherPair) on the roofs of two other
  buildings 15 to 25 m from the find_arrow roof, each with a clear line to it (building footprints
  and heights, parapets included) and as far apart around it as the roofs allow. Their roofs, and
  every roof those lines cross, get no rooftop clutter. Aggressive only when Kate is within 30 m.
* chapter 1's first fight: five ``City_Thug_<n>``. A Fists and a Bat thug (BP_Thug) face each
  other on the cross_block roof (tag RoofPair, counted by ``City_ThugGroup_clear_roof``, which
  completes ``clear_roof``); a Bat thug and the gunner patrol the Avenue A sidewalk beside the
  park between ``City_Patrol_0`` and ``City_Patrol_1`` (ATargetPoints 40 m apart, tag StreetPair);
  ``City_Thug_4``, the heavy (BP_Thug_Heavy, shield), walks his own 20 m of the same sidewalk
  between ``City_Patrol_2`` and ``City_Patrol_3`` near the park's south corner. The three street
  thugs are also tagged StreetGroup.
* the partner: ``City_ClintStart`` (an ATargetPoint 5 m behind the PlayerStart, toward the park)
  and ``City_Clint`` (BP_Clint) standing on it; BP_PartnerController possesses him at load.
* grapple anchors (``City_Anchor_<n>``, BP_GrappleAnchor): on every building over 8 m, one on
  the parapet at each roof corner and one mid-edge on edges over 25 m, none within 4 m of
  another, each with its landing point on the roof clear of the parapet.
* traversable ledges (``City_Ledge_<id>_<edge>``): a hidden Game Animation Sample
  LevelBlock_Traversable along every roof edge of 1 m or more, its Ledge_1 spline on the
  parapet's outer top edge, so the sample's vault and mantle see the tenements.
  Neither the anchors nor the ledges are saved in the map (5,400 actors made it 72 MB): they go
  into ``/Game/City/EastVillage/DA_EastVillage_CityProps`` (UCityLedgeData) and one
  ``City_LedgeSpawner`` (ACityLedgeSpawner) spawns them at BeginPlay. Parkour test
  blocks: ``City_Test_Vault`` (90 cm) and ``City_Test_Mantle`` (150 cm) on the street by the
  PlayerStart, and three low ``City_ParkWall_<n>`` in the park.
* fire escapes (``City_FireEscape_<id>_<floor>``): on every building 10 to 30 m tall, on the
  longest of its edges nearest a road, a landing per floor (330 cm apart from the second floor to
  at least 180 cm under the roof): a 240 x 90 x 8 cm slab 5 cm off the facade, 90 cm rails on
  its outer three sides with a traversable ledge on the outer rail, and a ladder down to the
  landing below, alternating ends. Black iron (M_SteelPainted). A building whose escape would
  hit another building, a street lamp or another escape gets none. Data in the same props
  asset, spawned by the same spawner.
* clutter (see clutter_plan): water towers, HVAC boxes and chimneys on the roofs, hydrants, bins and
  bags, scaffolding and parked cars on the street; data in the props asset, drawn by the spawner as
  one instanced mesh per kind.
* the world map (``/Game/City/EastVillage/DA_EastVillage_Map``, UCityMapData): every footprint and
  the park as a few-point 2D outline, every street piece as a simplified centre line with its width,
  and the ground rectangle's bounding box, all in world cm. UHawkeyeMapWidget draws it.

Idempotent: each mesh carries a ``CityHash`` metadata tag (hash of its source record and the
generator version); a mesh is rebuilt only when that hash changes. Actors are found by label
and compared before anything is set. The level is saved only when something changed. City
actors whose record disappeared are deleted.

# generation for a later world tick, and this headless commandlet never ticks, so the output could
# neither be saved nor checked by verify_city. The rules need the records (heights, roads, anchors,
