# Launches the Hawkeye game standalone (no editor UI) for fast iteration on feel.
# Refuses to start if an editor instance is already running - this machine has 16 GB RAM
# and editor + standalone game at once will thrash.
# Usage: .\Tools\play.ps1 [-Map /Game/Maps/L_District_EastVillage] [-Fullscreen] [-Notes]
#   -Map         play a different map instead of the district (L_District_EastVillage)
#   -Fullscreen  launch fullscreen instead of windowed at 1600x900
#   -Notes       wait for the game to close, then print the playtest session folder
#                (Saved\Playtest\<session>\: F12 notes, photos, summary.json, the log) and write
#                its report.md with Tools\playtest-report.py. See claude-docs\testing.md, "Playtest capture".
