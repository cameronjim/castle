# Combat animation

How strike, dodge, reaction, finisher and bow clips get from a download into the game, and what the
game does when a clip is missing. The rules themselves are in `gameplay-semantics.md`, "Combat
animation clips". Built 2026-09-27/28.

## The pipeline in one line

`Tools\import-anims.ps1` = `Tools/Editor/import_combat_anims.py` (import or copy, IK rigs, IK
retargeters, batch retarget, `AM_` montages) then `Tools/Editor/create_combat_anims.py` (fill the
`DA_AnimSet_` data assets and put them on the Blueprints). Everything reads
`Tools/Data/Anims/manifest.json`. `Tools\import-anims.ps1 -SelfTest` proves the whole path on clips
that are always on this machine.

## What was used, and why

| Need | Used | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Retargeting | The engine's IK Rig and IK Retargeter, driven from Python: `IKRigController` for the rigs, `IKRetargeterController` (`add_default_ops`, `auto_map_chains`, a target retarget pose with `auto_align_all_bones`, the root motion op controller), `IKRetargetBatchOperation.run_batch_retarget` for the clips | It is Epic's supported path in 5.8 and fully scriptable headless. Nothing written from scratch. |
| Target rigs | Built by the script from the manifest's chain maps, on the project's own meshes (`IK_Kate_UEFN`, `IK_Thug_Mannequin`) | Epic's `IK_UEFN_Mannequin` from the Game Animation Sample was tried first. Its stored skeleton lacks this project's `attach` bone, and every retargeted track came out one bone down the hierarchy (pelvis at the origin, spine carrying the pelvis). The self-test's raw-bone checks now catch that. GASP's `RTG_UEFN_to_*` retargeters all go from UEFN outward, so none could be reused for clips coming in. |
| Montages | `UHawkeyeCombatMontageBuilder` (C++, editor-only): the engine's `UAnimMontageFactory` plus `UAnimationBlueprintLibrary`'s notify calls | Python cannot set a montage's slot name; C++ can, and the compiler checks it. |
| Aiming strikes at the target | The engine's Motion Warping plugin: the `MotionWarping` component the sample already puts on Kate (one is added only to a character without one), a skew-warp window in each strike montage, the warp target `CombatTarget` | GASP's traversal already uses it on Kate; a second component would warp every clip twice. |
| Upper body over locomotion | Slots in the bow-IK post-process graph (`ABP_BowIK_Post`, `_Thug`): `DefaultSlot`, cached, then `UpperBody` layered from `spine_01` up in mesh space, then the existing lean, spine turn and two-bone IK | The graph was already built headless by `UHawkeyeBowIKGraphBuilder`, runs on every character, and runs after the main AnimBP, so IK can correct a clip's hands. The sample's own AnimBP is left untouched. |
| FBX import | `AssetImportTask` with `FbxImportUI` options, which 5.8 converts for Interchange | The documented scripted import; the self-test runs it on the engine's own FBX automation file. |
| Bow aim up, down and round | An engine Aim Offset (`UAimOffsetBlendSpace`, played by the anim graph's Aim Offset node, `UAnimGraphNode_RotationOffsetBlendSpace`), `BS_BowAimOffset_Sparrow` per skeleton: Sparrow's own `AO_idle` layout and its nine `idle_AO_*` poses retargeted, made mesh-space additive on the centre pose. Built by `UHawkeyeCombatMontageBuilder::BuildAimOffset` (C++, editor-only) | Aim offsets are Epic's tool for exactly this. The asset route worked, so no spine twist was hand-rolled for pitch. C++ because a blend space's axes are protected and its samples are added through editor-only calls. |

## Where clips play

- A montage whose slot is `UpperBody` (the bow clips) plays on the post-process instance, over
  locomotion from `spine_01` up, with the bow's aim offset on top of it (see "The bow clips").
- Any other montage plays full body: on Kate and Clint in the sample AnimBP's `DefaultSlot` (the same
  slot the parkour clips use), on thugs and archers in the post-process graph's `DefaultSlot`
  (their main instance is a single looping sequence and has no slots).
- `HawkeyeCombatAnim::PickInstance` makes that choice; everything else calls
  `HawkeyeCombatAnim::Play` or `PlayRole` and treats a null return as "use the fallback".

## The fallback rule

Every role is optional. An empty slot in the set, a montage that does not load, or one that will not
play (no anim instance, another skeleton) sends the code down exactly the path it had before clips:
the strike pose and lunge, the procedural dash, the hit lean, the ragdoll knockdown, the IK-only bow.
The automation tests run with no content, so they exercise the fallback every time;
`Hawkeye.CombatAnim.NoClipKeepsProceduralBehaviour` fills every role with a montage that cannot play
and checks the old timings.

## Skeletons

| Who | Skeleton | Target rig | Clips land in |
|-----|----------|------------|---------------|
| Kate, Clint | `SK_UEFN_Mannequin` (the sample's) | `IK_Kate_UEFN` | `/Game/Characters/UEFN_Mannequin/Animations/Combat` |
| Thugs, the heavy, the gunner, archers | `SK_Mannequin_Skeleton` (the UE4 mannequin in `/Game/Mannequin`) | `IK_Thug_Mannequin` | `/Game/Mannequin/Animations/Combat` |

Note the thugs are not on the UEFN skeleton: they wear the UE4 mannequin, so every clip a thug uses is
retargeted twice, once per target.

Chain maps (in the manifest, `chain_maps`): all use the same chain names as Epic's UEFN rig (Root,
Spine, Neck, Head, Left/RightClavicle, Left/RightArm, fingers, Left/RightLeg, Left/RightToe), so the
retargeter maps them by exact name.

| Map | Source | Retarget root | Root bone | Notes |
|-----|--------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| `mixamo` | Mixamo's rig: Hips, Spine..Spine2, Neck, Head, LeftShoulder, LeftArm..LeftHand, LeftHandThumb1..3 (and Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky), LeftUpLeg..LeftFoot, LeftToeBase | Hips | none | Bone names match with or without a `mixamorig:` prefix. With no root bone the root motion op generates root motion from the target pelvis: root straight under the pelvis, height snapped to the ground, reference rotation (see "Root motion from a rig with no root"). |
| `ue4` | UE4 mannequin and Paragon heroes (Sparrow): root, pelvis, spine_01..03, neck_01, head, clavicle, upperarm..hand, three-joint fingers, thigh..foot, ball | pelvis | root | 22 chains on Sparrow. |
| `uefn` | UEFN and UE5 mannequins: spine_01..05, neck_01..02 | pelvis | root | Kate's target; the self-test's UE5 source. |

## Root motion from a rig with no root

The IK Retargeter's root motion op, set to Generate From Target Pelvis, still defaults its height to
Copy Height From Source, which reads the source's root bone; Mixamo has none, so that is its first
bone, the hips. Every Mixamo clip came out with the root track at 85 to 92 cm and the pelvis's own
track about 2 cm above it (A_Light1_Cross: root z 89, pelvis 91 in component space at frame 0). The
import's pose line read the pelvis through the root and looked right; the game extracts the root as
root motion (Kate's strikes) or locks it (everything else), and the pelvis dropped to the floor. The
script now sets the op to Snap To Ground with no offset from the pelvis and no pelvis rotation, so the
root carries only the hips' horizontal travel (A_Light1_Cross after: root z 0, pelvis 91 to 94).

Two more things made that fix look like it did nothing: `IKRetargetFactory` can create the retargeter
with the default op stack already in, and a retargeter the script could not delete (still loaded)
came back with every earlier run's stack, so `add_default_ops` stacked more copies whose root motion
op sat at its defaults and ran last. The script clears the stack and adds exactly one. The import log
prints the op count ("6 ops": the default five and the Pin Bones op below).

## The IK bones

The UEFN and UE4 mannequins carry `ik_foot_l`, `ik_foot_r`, `ik_hand_l`, `ik_hand_r` and `ik_hand_gun`,
and the Game Animation Sample's AnimBP runs foot placement and leg IK toward the foot ones. A retarget
leaves them at their reference pose, so until 2026-09-28 every Mixamo clip had Kate's feet pulled back
to the reference stance in game: the kick's foot stayed on the floor at its hit and the strikes lost
their split stance. The retargeter now ends with a Pin Bones op that copies each from the foot or hand
it follows (translation and rotation, no offset: they coincide in both reference poses; the op's
"maintain offset" measures in the retarget pose, where the aligned legs have moved, and was 3 to 8 cm
off). The self-test checks the foot ones on the clip's keys.

## Timing a clip for play

Mixamo strikes are demo-paced: about a second of wind-up before the punch. A clip can say, in its
source's seconds, which stretch to play and how fast (`start_s`, `end_s`, `rate`) and where its windows
are (`hit_s`, `combo_s`, optional `warp_end_s`; the warp defaults to the hit). The montage builder puts
the stretch and rate into the montage's own segment (the montage editor's Start Time, End Time and
Play Rate), so the montage is short and plays at rate 1, and maps the windows into it. A hit lands
`(hit_s[0] - start_s) / rate` after the input. The numbers for Kate's clips come from the fist or foot's
forward reach from the pelvis per frame (read with `GetRawBoneLocation`): the hit window opens when
the striking hand is about two thirds out, and the stretch starts at or just before the cocked pose.

| Clip | Variant | Stretch (s) | Rate | Hit after input | Combo window | Montage |
|------|---------|-------------|------|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| AM_Light1_Cross (right cross) | 1 of 2 | 0.60-1.70 | 1.7 | 0.25 s | 0.34-0.62 s | 0.65 s |
| AM_Light1_Punching (left jab from a dip) | 2 of 2 | 0.13-1.00 | 1.5 | 0.25 s | 0.33-0.56 s | 0.58 s |
| AM_Light2_Hook | 1 of 2 | 0.70-1.75 | 1.3 | 0.25 s | 0.35-0.77 s | 0.81 s |
| AM_Light2_Boxing (jab, then the right cross that hits) | 2 of 2 | 0.25-1.05 | 1.4 | 0.25 s | 0.33-0.55 s | 0.57 s |
| AM_Light3_UppercutJab (the left uppercut) | 1 of 2 | 0.45-1.25 | 1.4 | 0.24 s | 0.34-0.55 s | 0.57 s |
| AM_Light3_JabElbow (the left jab; the elbow after it is cut) | 2 of 2 | 0.48-1.40 | 1.7 | 0.25 s | 0.34-0.52 s | 0.54 s |
| AM_Kick_Kicking (the front kick) | 1 of 2 | 0.20-1.35 | 1.2 | 0.29 s | 0.46-0.92 s | 0.96 s |
| AM_Kick_SideKick | 2 of 2 | 0.20-1.45 | 1.4 | 0.29 s | 0.46-0.87 s | 0.89 s |
| AM_Heavy_Roundhouse (right roundhouse kick) | 1 of 1 | 0.40-1.65 | 1.2 | 0.39 s | 0.58-1.00 s | 1.04 s |
| AM_Heavy_SurpriseUppercut | out of the set | 0.65-1.80 | 1.1 | 0.41 s | 0.59-1.00 s | 1.05 s |

Variants (2026-09-28): each strike takes the next clip of its role in manifest order; the log line
"... variant 2 of 2 for ECombatAnimRole::Light1: AM_Light1_Punching" says which. Kate's heavy is the
Roundhouse only since 2026-09-29: side on, the Surprise Uppercut's hit window shows her back, hips 47
degrees turned and the fist still 46 cm out to her right at 101 cm, while the roundhouse's foot is 61 cm
out at 83 cm; a later trim would not help, the turn is the move. It stays imported with `"in_set": false`
until a better second heavy exists. The second variants were measured the same
way (`GetRawBoneLocation` per frame of the retargeted `A_` clip): the hit opens when the fist or foot is
80 to 90% of its way out. The Roundhouse's standing leg straightens from her bent-knee idle: her pelvis
is 16 cm above standing at the hit (95 against 79 cm), the standing foot flat on the ground.
The Kick role plays Kicking first (2026-09-28): at the side kick's hit Kate's torso is near flat over her
standing hip, head at 123 cm (its import `check` line says so: head +23 at mid-clip); the front kick
stays upright (head 142 cm) and lands at the same time. Side Kick is the second kick variant; only the
Light3 fallback and the kick shot play the Kick role, so whether it stays is Cameron's call. The thugs'
fists alternate Jab To Elbow and Standing Melee Punch (both fitted to the telegraph; the jab first since
2026-09-29, see below); the run-jump attack is `"in_set": false`.

Thug strikes are trimmed the same way but kept at rate 1 in the manifest; the melee component fits
them to the attack's telegraph when they play (`HawkeyeCombatAnim::FitHitToWindup`): the rate that
puts the hit window on the telegraph's end, held between 0.8x and 1.3x; past 1.3x the clip starts
later in its wind-up, below 0.8x it holds its first frame first. The log line says which ("plays
AM_Light1_MeleePunch at 0.80x from 0.00 s, held 0.29 s") and "hit window opens 0.61 s into the swing".
The numbers come from the striking hand's forward reach per frame, as for Kate's.

| Clip | Stretch (s) | Hit (s) | Swings | Fit, hit lands at | Hit to end |
|------|-------------|---------|--------|-------------------|------------|
| AM_Light1_JabElbow (fists, first variant) | 0.30-1.40 | 0.85-0.95 | fists 0.6 s | 0.92x, 0.60 s | 0.60 s |
| AM_Light1_MeleePunch (fists, second variant) | 0.00-0.75 | 0.25-0.35 | fists 0.6 s | held 0.29 s, 0.8x, 0.60 s | 0.63 s |
| AM_Heavy_MeleeHorizontal | 0.00-1.50 | 0.87-0.97 | bat 0.6 s, bash 0.8 s, slow swing 1.0 s | 1.3x from 0.09 s, 0.60 s; 1.09x, 0.80 s; 0.87x, 1.00 s | 0.48, 0.58, 0.72 s |
| AM_Heavy_RunJumpAttack (`in_set: false`) | 0.55-2.40 | 1.64-1.74 | | a jump attack; its pelvis leaves the ground | |

Standing Melee Punch has only 0.25 s of wind-up, hence the hold; the Jab To Elbow jab fits 0.6 s
with none. Since 2026-09-29 the jab is the first fists variant: `thug_punch.png` and `thug_punch_2.png`
(0.3 s into the telegraph, side on) show the jab with his guard up (right hand at 160 cm) and the punch
still in its held first frame, hands low (107 to 112 cm), which reads as standing about, not winding up. The thug's reactions: Knocked
Out plays 0.80-2.60 s (0.9 s of standing still cut; on the floor by 1.4 s, holding its last frame
there), Sweep Fall 0.60-2.00 s (starts as his feet go). Receive Punch To The Face starts reacting on
its second frame and is untrimmed.

## The bow clips

Rebuilt 2026-09-28 after Cameron's playtest ("the bow animation is not natural"). The still
`bow_aim_full.png` looked right; the draw in motion did not. `Hawkeye.Screenshot.BowDraw` (below)
stopped time at each moment of a real draw and showed why, with numbers in its log:

1. **The draw clip was stretched to the draw time.** `RMB_Drawback` is Sparrow's 2.47 s charged shot
   (the string hand creeps back from 0.2 s to 2.2 s), and the code fitted it to Kate's 0.8 s draw at
   3.1x. Its auto blend-out then started before its end: 0.6 s into the draw its montage read position
   0 and the clip alpha was falling, the bow hand's IK coming back on, before `BowAimIdle` blended in at
   full draw. A dip in the middle of every draw.
2. **No aim offset.** At 30 degrees up or down the bow arm did not move (hand_l height the same to a
   centimetre); the bow turned in the hand and the string hand IK, keeping its offset from the grip
   along the aim, dragged the draw hand down to her stomach (aiming up) or over her head (aiming down).
3. **The IK overrode the clip's string hand.** Its target under a clip was the grip plus the procedural
   offsets, which put the string hand 20 cm to the right of the bow: the nocked arrow pointed 20 to 25
   degrees off where the arrow would fly (logged as "arrow ... deg off the launch").
4. **The bow went on her back with the arms still up.** The follow-through ended at 0.6 s while the
   fire clip still held the arms at full weight, so her bow hand held nothing. (With the shorter fire
   clip the opposite showed next: the clip was gone by 0.43 s and the follow-through's IK lifted the
   empty-handed arm back up. A shot on a clip now follows through only until the clip blends out.)

After (same log): the nocked arrow is 2 to 6 degrees off the launch direction when held (was 20 to
31), the string hand 3 to 7 cm off the arrow line at level aim with a correction of 0 to 0.13, and the
bow arm pitches with the aim: the bow hand is 39 cm above the actor at level aim, 60 at 30 degrees up
and 17 at 30 down (it was 50 at all three).

What plays now (numbers in `gameplay-semantics.md`, "Combat animation clips"):

| Role | Sparrow clip | Stretch | Montage | Notes |
|------|--------------|---------|---------|-------|
| BowDraw | Primary_Fire_Med | 0.43-0.93 s, rate 1 | 0.50 s, holds its last frame | The hand from the arrow rest to the anchor; the pull itself is 0.33 s. Ends on the idle's first pose. |
| BowAimIdle | idle | all 10 s, loops | 10 s | Sparrow's idle is her drawn stance, breathing. |
| BowFire | Primary_Fire_Med | 0.00-0.43 s | 0.43 s | The snap, then the hand back to the string: where BowDraw starts, so a re-draw runs on. |

Sparrow's `Primary_Fire_*` clips are whole shots (release, nock, draw); the stretches above were found
by reading the hands per frame (`GetRawBoneLocation`: the string hand's distance from the bow hand goes
74 cm at the anchor, 101 at the release's follow-through, 19 at the nock, back to 74). The bow roles blend
in over 0.15 s and out over 0.25 s. The draw's pace is the clip's; the draw fraction (damage, the
perfect window) keeps its own clock, so Kate is at the anchor at 0.5 s and at full strength at 0.8 s.

Under a clip the IK follows it: the clip alpha is the UpperBody slot's weight, so the bow hand's IK is
exactly as far off as the clip is in; the bow rides in the clip's hand; the string hand stays on the
clip with a correction toward the arrow line of at most 0.5 (none within 3 cm), its pole the clip's
own elbow. The correction needs the clip's hand before the IK moved it: the post-process instance
recovers it from the last pose, since the two-bone IK blends the hand's component-space position
linearly by its alpha (`clip = (final - alpha * target) / (1 - alpha)`).

The aim offset is built by `import_combat_anims.py` from the manifest's `aim_offsets` block: the nine
`BowAimOffset_<pose>` clips (CC, CU, CD, LC, LU, LD, RC, RU, RD) are retargeted like any clip (full
poses, additive off), then made mesh-space additive on the retargeted CC pose, and
`BS_BowAimOffset_Sparrow` is laid out as Sparrow's `AO_idle` (its axes, ranges and each pose's place);
the back poses (LB*, RB*) are left out since she always turns to face the aim. `create_bow_ik.py` puts an
Aim Offset node after the UpperBody slot in both bow graphs, fed `AimOffsetYaw`, `AimOffsetPitch` and
`AimOffsetAlpha` (clip alpha times bow alpha) from `UHawkeyeBowIKAnimInstance`, and sets the asset on
the Blueprint's defaults so the instance clamps its inputs to its range. Without the asset the graph
has no node and everything is as before.

## Sources

- `mixamo_fbx`: a folder of FBX. The source's `mesh_file` (one clip downloaded With Skin) imports as
  a skeletal mesh and defines the skeleton; then every clip, that one included, imports as an
  animation onto it (`/Game/AnimSources/<Source>/A_Src_<File>`). Frames snap to 30 fps.
- `uasset_project`: clips in another project's `Content` folder. The clips, the source mesh and their
  hard-reference closure are copied to the same `/Game/` paths, never overwriting.
  `Tools/Editor/_packages.py` reads the import tables of both UE 5.8 and UE4 packages (the Paragon
  packs were saved by 4.19), so a copy takes what a package loads and nothing else: Sparrow's six
  clips are 3 MB, its mesh with materials 730 MB.

Paragon's hit reactions are additive over its idle. They are retargeted with additive off
(`retain_additive_flags=False`), which bakes idle plus hit into a full pose; kept additive they played
as garbage in a full-body slot and pointed at Sparrow's idle on Sparrow's skeleton.

## How to add a clip

1. Put the file in `Tools/Data/Anims/<Source>/` (or the pack in its project) and add a line to
   `manifest.json` `clips`: `source`, `file` or `asset`, `role`, `variant`, `characters`
   (`kate`, `clint`, `thug`, `archer`, `all`, or a list).
2. Optional per clip: `hit`, `combo` (fractions of the clip), `warp_end`, `loop`, `hold`,
   `root_motion`, `blend_in`, `blend_out`, `slot`; or the timing keys in seconds of the source clip,
   `start_s`, `end_s`, `rate`, `hit_s`, `combo_s`, `warp_end_s` (see "Timing a clip for play"). `"in_set": false` imports a clip but keeps it out of the anim set. Leave the timing keys out to take `ROLE_DEFAULTS` in
   `import_combat_anims.py` (strikes: hit 25-45%, combo 45-80%, warp to the hit; heavy 40-55%, 60-85%;
   Knockdown holds its last frame; BowAimIdle loops; bow roles play `UpperBody`).
3. `.\Tools\import-anims.ps1` (add `-Force` to redo existing assets). Read the log: one `created`
   line per montage with its windows, one `pose` (or `check`) line per retargeted clip with its
   pelvis height at start, middle and end against the reference, and the head and hands.
4. When a role has several clips, all of them go in the set in manifest order: the first in the role's
   slot, the rest in `MoreVariants`. Strikes cycle through them; every other role plays the first.
   Reorder the manifest to change the order, `"in_set": false` to leave one out. Hand-made
   `AM_<Role>_*` montages in the folder come after, by name.
5. Commit the manifest and the `DA_AnimSet_` assets. The clips, the copies and the retargeted
   results are git-ignored (Mixamo's and Epic's content is not republished); a fresh clone rebuilds
   them with the script.

## Checking without looking

Nobody can watch a headless run, so the scripts read bones:

- `--selftest` retargets two of GASP's UE5 mannequin clips (another skeleton, a `uasset_project`
  source), the engine's `FbxEditorAutomation/AnimatedCharacter.fbx` (an FBX source with no root bone),
  and Sparrow's `RMB_Drawback` and `HitReact_Fwd` to both targets, then asserts: on the target
  skeleton, the source's length, only target bones in the tracks, full-pose not additive, the right
  slot and windows, standing clips standing (pelvis within 35 cm of the reference, hips and head
  where they belong, and the pelvis within 15 cm of the reference with the root locked: the engine's
  FBX character has no root bone, so this is the check that fails if the root takes the hips' height), and for the bow draw: the bow arm as extended as the source's, the bow hand
  30+ cm in front, the string hand drawn back 40+ cm behind it at full draw; and `ik_foot_l` and
  `ik_foot_r` on the feet on every key. 134 checks.
- Poses are read from the raw bone tracks with `UHawkeyeCombatMontageBuilder::GetRawBoneLocation`
  (`bRootLocked` holds the root at its reference pose, as the game does; the `pose` line prints both).
  `AnimPoseExtensions` evaluation gave the pelvis as the origin on some UEFN clips while its children
  were right, so it is not trusted for this.
- `Hawkeye.Smoke.ThugClipsStrikeOnTheTelegraph` swings the district's street thug (fists, bat) and the
  heavy (bash, slow swing) with their clips and checks each hit window opens on the telegraph's end.
- `Hawkeye.Screenshot.Melee` shoots two heavies and the kick side on at their hit windows
  (heavy_strike.png, heavy_strike_2.png, kick.png) and fails on the wrong montage (the second heavy
  repeating the first's clip is wrong), or a pelvis more than 15 cm below standing or 20 cm above it.
- `Hawkeye.Smoke.CombatClipsPlay` loads the district and plays each character's clips: the slot's
  global weight must be above 0 a quarter second later, and Kate's Light1 must still be winding up
  before its `ANS_HitWindow` and recovering after it (the notify firing from a real montage).
- `Hawkeye.Screenshot.BowDraw` (standalone game) draws on the world clock at 0.25x and stops time
  (global dilation 0.0001) at 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0 s into a draw, held 30 degrees up and down, 0.1 s
  after the release, 0.3 s into a re-draw, twice while strafing, and 0.6 s after a second release;
  each moment is a side-front shot and one through her own camera (`Saved/Screenshots/BowDraw/`). Its
  log gives the clip, the slot weight, every IK alpha, the string hand's distance off the arrow line
  and the nocked arrow's angle to the launch direction for each.

## Known limits

- Kate's clip-timed lights land at 0.25 s, not the procedural 0.1 s (a clip needs a visible swing).
- Every second fists swing (Standing Melee Punch) still holds its first frame for 0.29 s of the 0.6 s
  telegraph (its wind-up is short); the first (Jab To Elbow) needs no hold. Leaving the punch out of the
  set (`"in_set": false`) would make every swing the jab, at the cost of variety.
- There is no GetUp clip yet: a Mixamo knockdown holds its last frame on the floor, then blends back
  to locomotion over 0.4 s.
- The aim offset under-pitched (Sparrow's CU and CD poses sit at +-90 on the axis but aim less far): at
  30 degrees up the nocked arrow pointed 24 up. Fixed 2026-09-29 by scaling the pitch input (1.57 up,
  1.85 down, +5; gameplay-semantics.md, "Aim offset pitch"): 30.6 up, -30.2 down, -1.5 level. Looking
  down the arrow now follows the view while it flies along a shallower line from the bow hand (the
  string hand sits 34 cm off that line with the correction at its 0.5 cap); it still flies to the
  reticle.
- The first 0.1 s of a draw is still a blend from locomotion: the bow turns up in the hand while the
  arms rise, and the nocked arrow points down across the body (28 degrees off) for a few frames.
- `bow_aim_half.png` (the BowIK still at half draw) shows the anchor: the draw clip is at its end
  after 0.5 s whatever the draw fraction, which is the new rule, not a fault.
- The clip set has no BowNock: after the fire clip the arms blend to locomotion and the bow goes on the
